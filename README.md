My technical expertise spans across the entire software development lifecycle, with a focus on front-end development and technical leadership. 

My approach to development is grounded in clean coding techniques and meticulous tool implementation, ensuring that every project I work on meets the highest standards of quality and usability. With a strong background in e-commerce problem-solving, I have a keen understanding of the unique challenges of developing software that delivers results in a dynamic and fast-paced environment.

I am deeply committed to the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD) and believe that a well-designed software architecture and comprehensive documentation are critical to the success of any project. My skill set includes expertise in TypeScript, React, and NodeJs, making me match to any team looking to build robust and scalable software solutions.
